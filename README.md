# Geek Factory FIFO Library #
This is a generic FIFO buffer that can be used to store any kind of items. It is written in C language and can be compiled and used on almost any architecture. It was designed to be used on memory limited achitectures such as microcontrollers. Examples of the applications that can be build with this library include:

* Work queues.
* Message queues.
* FIFO buffers for data I/O.
* Program synchronization.
* Any other applications that requires FIFO style data storage.

As with most of our libraries, it is designed to run on the popular Arduino platform, as well as other common architectures, such as the PIC16 and PIC 18 microcontrollers from Microchip.

## Basic library usage ##

The following example ilustrates the library usage.

## Project objectives ##

* Improve program modularity and reliability by creating common data structures.
* Provide a portable implementation of a FIFO data structure.
* Strong portability, specially on embedded systems, by using C language.
* Provide functions for static memory allocation applications.
* Easy to configure, use and understand.

## Supported devices ##

This library was developed/tested on the following boards

* Arduino UNO R3
* Arduino Mega 2560 R3
